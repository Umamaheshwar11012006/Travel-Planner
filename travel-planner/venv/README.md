# Travel Planner Using Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Project Idea
A travel planner where users add cities and routes and find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path in a weighted graph from source to destination.  
Implemented manually without external libraries.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(V^2) in this implementation.

## How to Run
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
2. Install Flask: `pip install flask`
3. Run `main.py`: `python main.py`
4. Open browser at `http://localhost:5000/`
5. Add cities, routes, and find shortest paths via web UI
